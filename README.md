In this code, I worked on developing a Java game called **ShadowMario**, where the player controls a character to collect coins, avoid enemies, and reach the end flag to win. I implemented key game elements such as player movement, collision detection, scoring, health management, and win/lose conditions, following object-oriented design principles. The game uses 2D graphics, handles input through arrow keys, and updates the game state in real-time.
